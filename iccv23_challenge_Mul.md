# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to ICCV'23 Sensor Fusion SLAM Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

In the sensor fusion track, we exclusively offer access to high-quality **sensor-fusion** datasets sourced from SubT-MRS. These datasets encompass various challenging conditions such as **"lighting changes, darkness, smoke, self-similar environments and more"**. For the other two tracks, see here: [Visual-Inertial SLAM Challenge](https://superodometry.com/iccv23_challenge_VI) and [Lidar-Inertial SLAM Challenge](https://superodometry.com/iccv23_challenge_LiI).

Seize this chance to demonstrate your skills and compete among the finest in the field!

Three separate awards will be given for each track.
Your SLAM performance in <b>the Sensor Fusion track will not impact</b> the scores in other tracks.
Join us now to become a vital part of cutting-edge advancements in robotics and sensor fusion! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡ Let your expertise shine in this thrilling competition!

<span style="font-size:1.3em;">If you have any question, please do not hesitate to post issues on this [github website](https://github.com/water-horse/ICCV2023_SLAM_Challenge.git). We would love to hear from your feedback! Every post will be responded with no spared effort within 36 hours.<span>

## Evaluation 
The submission is evaluated based on Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) and Relative Pose Error (RPE). Specifically, The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ATE and RPE of every trajectory in the sensor fusion track and its bonus track will be evaluated. The final score for a submitted trajectory will be assigned according to the following rule. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
Score_{ATE,RPE} = \ 20 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ RMSE \le 1.0 \ m \\
10 \ \ \ \ \ 1.0 \ m < RMSE \le 2.0 \ m \\
6 \ \ \ \ \ 2.0 \ m < RMSE \le 3.0 \ m \\
5 \ \ \ \ \ 3.0 \ m < RMSE \le 4.0 \ m \\
3 \ \ \ \ \ 4.0 \ m < RMSE \le 5.0 \ m \\
1 \ \ \ \ \ 5.0 \ m < RMSE \le 6.0 \ m \\
0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ RMSE > 6.0 \ m \\
\end{aligned}
$$

What's more, we will also evaluate the trajectory based on a velocity error (VE) metric. VE is calculated by measuring the velocity difference sampled at a fixed frequency between the submitted trajectory and our groundtruth trjectory. The velocity of your submitted trajectory will be calculated by performing a B-spline interpolation and approximating the instant velocity by the average velocity in short time intervals. As a substitution, you can also submit a velocity file (instructions for this is coming soon). At every sampled point, the velocity difference will be transformed to a score according to the following rule. The RMSE of the per-point scores will be calculated to obtain the final VE score. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
Score_{point_i} = \ 20 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ error_{point_i} \le 0.5 \ m/s \\
10 \ \ \ \ \ 0.5 \ m/s < error_{point_i} \le 1.0 \ m/s \\
6 \ \ \ \ \ 1.0 \ m/s < error_{point_i}\le 1.5 \ m/s \\
5 \ \ \ \ \ 1.5 \ m/s < error_{point_i} \le 2.0 \ m/s \\
3 \ \ \ \ \ 2.0 \ m/s < error_{point_i} \le 2.5 \ m/s \\
1 \ \ \ \ \ 2.5 \ m/s < error_{point_i} \le 3.0 \ m/s \\
0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ error_{point_i} > 6.0 \ m/s \\
\end{aligned}
$$


## Submit the results. 

### Prepare the trajectory
For each of the 6 trajectories of **sensor-fusion track**, you need to compute the **poses in IMU coordinate frame**, and save them in the text file with the name sequnce_name.txt. Put all 6 files into a zip file with the following structure: 

```
    Multi_Model_Sensor_Fusion.zip
    â”œâ”€â”€ SubT_MRS_Hawkins_Long_Corridor_RC.txt            # result file for the trajectory Long Corridor 
    â”œâ”€â”€ SubT_MRS_Hawkins_Multi_Floor_LegRobot.txt        # result file for the trajectory Multi Floor 
    â”œâ”€â”€ SubT_MRS_MILL19_Block_LiDAR.txt                  # result file for the trajectory Block LiDAR 
    â”œâ”€â”€ SubT_MRS_MILL19_Block_Visual.txt                 # result file for the trajectory Block Visual   
    â”œâ”€â”€ SubT_MRS_Flash_Light_LegRobot.txt                # result file for the trajectory Flash Light
    â”œâ”€â”€ SubT_MRS_Hawkins_Smoke_Handheld.txt              # result file for the smoke room 
    â””â”€â”€ Subt_MRS_Outdoor_Night_LegRobot.txt              # result file for the outdoor night
  
```
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

The text file should have the following format: 

```
# timestamp_s tx ty tz qx qy qz qw
1.403636580013555527e+09 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


It is a text file containing the translation and orientation of the IMU in a fixed coordinate frame. The estimated trajectory file should satisfy the following requirements.
- Each line in the text file contains a single pose.
- The number of lines/poses must be the same as the number of image frames in that trajectory. 
- The format of each line is 'timestamp_s tx ty tz qx qy qz qw'. 
- tx ty tz (3 floats) give the position of IMU sensor to the world origin in the world frame.
- qx qy qz qw (4 floats) give the orientation of IMU in the form of a unit quaternion with respect to the world frame. 
- The trajectory can have an arbitrary initial position and orientation. However, we are using the IMU frame to define the motion. That is to say, the x-axis is pointing to forward, the y-axis is pointing left, the z-axis is pointing up.

### Submit in Gradescope  

To submit the estimated trajectory into the submission system, you can follow the steps listed below:

1. Register a account in the [GradeScope](http://gradescope.com/) and log into the website.
2. Click the right-bottom `Add Course` button and enter the course-entry code: `G2YGGB`, Then you can find the `iccv-mul` courses in your GradeScope homepage.
3. Click the `iccv-mul` course and you will see the assignment named `Trajectory-result-submission` in the dashboard.
4. Click the assignment and upload your `Sensor_Fusion.zip` file. Also please remember to input the group name as the leaderboard name. Then click the upload button.
    - You should directly compress the estimated result files of the trajectories into a zip file, not the folder containing the result files.
5. After around 1 minutes, you will see the APE and RPE result of your trajectory in the leaderboard.


### Submit Report

Participants are requested to submit a report describing their methods along with the gradescope submission. A template for the same is provided here : <a href="Report/ICCV_Report_Template.zip" download> ICCV_Template_Report </a> . Please include your report pdf in the `Sensor_Fusion.zip` file.


## Challenge Rules 
1. Participants are welcome to form teams. A participant cannot be in multiple teams and a team must make submissions under a single account.  
2. Every day a team can submit for at most once on gradescope and the submission must be in a certain time window: 12:00 P.M. - 11:59 P.M. UTC. 
3. The size of every trajectory file submitted should be no more than 2 MB.  
4. Every team <b>must submit a report</b> along with the gradescope submissions.  
5. Organizers reserve the right to make changes to the rules and timeline.  
6. Violation of the rules or other unfair activities may result in disqualification.  

##  ðŸŽ‰Sensor-Fusion Leaderboard ðŸŽ‰

Leaderboard will be open on Gradescope when there is still enough time before the challenge ends.
